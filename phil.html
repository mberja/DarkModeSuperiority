                ABCD is part of the Community Action Network, created with the passage of the Economic Opportunity Act, which was signed into law in 1964. The Act was a sweeping plan to improve the lives of all Americans, regardless of their circumstances. 
                <br> <br />
                As a community action agency, ABCD has a tripartite board structure consisting of members from the local private sector, public sector, and low-income community who are democratically selected by a local ABCD Advisory Board of their peers. Leaders from each of these groups collaborate on developing responses to local needs for our most underserved and at-risk neighbors.

                Boston Cares mobilizes and trains individual and corporate volunteers who strengthen communities and improve the lives of people in need. We partner with schools and nonprofits with needs that can be filled by volunteer teams; then we recruit, train and lead reliable groups of volunteers who get the job done.
                <br><br />
                Boston Cares is the largest volunteer agency in New England, an Innovation Hub within the global Points of Light network, and an award-winning leader in the volunteer engagement sector. Since 1991, our volunteers have generated over 1 million hours of service!

                Habitat for Humanity is a charitable nonprofit organization dedicated to building simple low-cost homes by forming partnerships with low-income families in need of decent and affordable housing. We believe homeownership is a vital step to help families break the cycle of poverty and contributes to pride in families and communities.
                <br><br />
                Habitat for Humanity has been building strength, stability, and self-reliance through shelter in the Greater Boston area since 1987. Hundreds of low-income people live in Habitat homes in local communities such as Belmont, Malden, Needham, Newton, and many Boston neighborhoods including Dorchester, Roslindale, Roxbury, and South Boston.

                The Soccer Without Borders mission is to use soccer as a vehicle for positive change, providing under-served youth with a toolkit to overcome obstacles to growth, inclusion, and personal success.
                <br> <br />
                We believe in the learning that comes from a quality process that focuses on what is within our control: creating a culture of acceptance, addressing obstacles to an inclusive environment, and supporting progress toward individual, team and community goals.
