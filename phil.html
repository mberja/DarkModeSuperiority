                <p style = "font-size: 18px;">Action for Boston Community Development (ABCD) is part of the Community Action Network, created with the passage of the Economic Opportunity Act, which was signed into law in 1964. The Act was a sweeping plan to improve the lives of all Americans, regardless of their circumstances. </p>

                <p style = "font-size: 18px;">As a community action agency, ABCD has a tripartite board structure consisting of members from the local private sector, public sector, and low-income community who are democratically selected by a local ABCD Advisory Board of their peers. Leaders from each of these groups collaborate on developing responses to local needs for our most underserved and at-risk neighbors.</p>
