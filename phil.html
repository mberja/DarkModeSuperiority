        <h1>OUR MISSION</h1>
        <article>
            <p style = "text-align: center">It all started in January of 2020 when four milk-tea loving pals finished the last sips of their daily milk teas. They thought to themselves, “Wow, wouldn’t it be great to have a tea shop of our own?” Little did they know that their passion for milk tea was bigger than they could ever imagine. However, with countless milk tea shops in the Boston area, they were determined to make themselves stand out. After days of brainstorming and daydreaming, the idea for Philantrotea was born.</p>
             
            <p style = "text-align: center">Here at Philanthrotea, we emphasize the purest essence of philanthropy--the desire to promote the well-being of others and our community. We believe it is our mission to continuously challenge the status quo for ethical branding and consumption. Our teas are delicious and you’ll be able to taste the depth of quality in our ingredients as you take the first sip. Making fantastic tea is our expertise, but giving back is our passion. When you purchase a Philanthrotea drink, 15% of the cost will go to a non-profit organization in the Boston Area. Buy good, do good, feel good. </p>
